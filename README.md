# coupled_ecohydrofire_model
Analysis of the coupled ecohydrologic (RHESSys) and fire-spread (WMFire) models. The objective of this study is to examine whether the model can replicate fire regimes (e.g. fire return intervals) for selected Western U.S. landscapes. We will also test the sensitivity of fire return intervals to various components of the model.
